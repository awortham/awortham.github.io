It is incredible to think back over the last few years. My family and I have been
on quite a journey. A few years ago, I made a career switch from being a CNC
machinist to web developer. I packed up my family and moved half way across the
country to pursue this new opportunity and dream at Turing School of Software
and Design.

My wife and I were married in 2011 and since then have had three kids in four years.
Our three kids keep things hopping. Basically, if things are noisy then I assume
everything must be ok. We now live in Durango, Colorado and spend our spare time
hiking and biking the La Plata Mountains and soaking in the incredible views
surrounding Durango.

### Why Do I enjoy Web Development

Web development is like a great game of chess combined with a beautiful work of
art. There is an immense element of problem solving and strategy combined with
making the code something to be proud of, something beautiful.

I also LOVE the fact that I cannot master this thing overnight. I have worked
jobs in the past that after a short period of time I became board and was looking
for a new challenge. The web development world is so vast. There are so many
frameworks, languages and new technologies being developed even as I write this, that
I cannot possibly master it to the point of getting board. There is always more
to learn and I love that about it.
