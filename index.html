    My name is Aaron Wortham. I got my start in Ruby on Rails with Turing web
    Development School. (Turing.io) I have experience with both front end and
    back end web development. While Rails is my first love, I have built in JQuery,
    JavaScript, Slim, Haml and have also built in Sinatra and straight Ruby. I
    operate at my best when building using Test driven development. I have used
    both RSpec and MiniTest. I have a passion for learning and perfecting my trade
    and for using my talents and gifts to better the community and people around
    me.
