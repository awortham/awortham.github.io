    My name is Aaron Wortham. I got my start in Ruby on Rails with Turing School
    of Software and Design. (Turing.io) While my main responsibilities are working
    in back end development and Ubuntu servers, I also do a fair amount of JavaScript
    and JQuery as well.

    I have experience with many facets of Rails engineering from a basic Ruby
    on Rails web application to building gems and Rails engines. I have also built
    in Sinatra and pure Ruby programs. I operate at my best when  using test
    driven development. I have used both RSpec and MiniTest. I have a passion for
    learning and perfecting my trade and for using my talents and gifts to better
    the community and people around me.
